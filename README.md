## Description

This is a trivia game with an animal facts theme.  Starting the game brings up a multiple choice question and starts a 30 second timer.  The result is given after an answer is seleted or the timer runs out.  After 3 seconds, the next answer will populate.

## Usage

This project was an exercise in Javascript timers.  It uses setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, and clearInterval.

JQuery was heavily used to populate HTML content, change attributes, and add event listeners.

## Roadmap

I would love to add more questions to fill out the application more.
